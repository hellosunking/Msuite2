This README file covers the following topics:

1. Installation
2. How to run Mviewer
3. Output explanation


1. Installation

Mviewer is written in Perl and Bash for Linux/Unix platform. To run Mviewer you need a Linux/Unix
machine with Bash 3 (or higher) and Perl 5.10 (or higher) installed.

After uncompressing this source package, the installation is completed. No further installation is needed.

NOTE: Mviewer depends on a program called "wkhtmltopdf" (http://wkhtmltopdf.org). The copy in this package
is built for x86_64 platform. If you are using other platforms, please download one for your platform and
replace the copy in the "bin/" directory.


2. How to run Mviewer

The main program is "Mviewer". You can add the path to Mviewer to your ".bashrc" file under the "PATH"
variable to call it from anywhere, or you can run the following command to add it to your current session:

   user@linux$ PATH=$PATH:$PWD


Call "Mviewer" without any parameters to see the usage (or use '-h' option):


Mviewer: a component of the Msuite package for visualization of DNA methylation data
Version 1.0.0, Apr 2020
Written by Kun Sun (sunkun@szbl.ac.cn)

=================================================================================
Usage: Mviewer [options] -f align.bam -r query.bed -g genome

Parameters:

Compulsory:

  -f  align.bam     Specify the path to the Msuite alignment result (bam format)

                    Please confirm that the BAM file has been sorted and
                    the index file (.bam.bai) also exists.
                    Note that Msuite always generate both files.

  -r  query.region  Specify the query region in chrX:XXX,XXX,XXX-XXX,XXX,XXX format

  -g  genome        Set the genome version

                    Note: you must have the "GENOME.fa" and "GENOME.info" files under
                    the "genome" directory where "GENOME" is your parameter.

Optional:

  -o  output.dir    Specify the output directory [recommended]
                    Default: create and use a new sub-directory called 'Mvis'

  -d  level         Build a dense view with the given level
                    Supports 0 (no dense view), 1 (light dense) and 2 (heavy dense)
                    Default: 0

  -e                Set this flag will force the program to show exact regions as
                    specified in the query.bed (i.e., cut the basepairs outside)
                    Default: Unset

  -s                Set this flag to sort the reads by genotyping information
                    on SNP sites (if any; automatically detected)
                    Default: Unset; reads are sort by genomic coordination

  -h                Show this help massage and exit

Mviewer: a component of the Msuite for visualization of DNA methylation data



IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. By default, Mviewer will automatically extend the specified region to include the full size of all the
   reads that overlap the original region. If you do not want this feature, then please set the "-e" flag and
   Mviewer will force to visualize exactly the region provided through trimming the sequence outside the
   specified region for each read.
2. Mviewer supports dense view of the data which only keeps the CpG sites while ommits all the non-CpG
   sequence. 2 levels of dense are provided. However, the dense view will be recorded in a separate file and
   the original visualization outputs will NOT be overwritten.


For example, if your file is "/path/to/Maligner.bam" and your reference sequence is "/path/to/hg18fa", you want
to visualize a region chr7:129919950-129920150 (promoter of MEST gene) and want to write the results into
"/path/to/result/" with default parameters, simply run:

   user@linux$ Mviewer -f /path/to/Maligner.bam -r chr7:129919950-129920150 \
							-g /path/to/hg18.chr7.fa -o /path/to/result/


3. Outputs explanation

Mviewer outputs all the results for the given region in the directory specified by "-o OUTDIR" option (if not
specified, Mviewer will use the defaultvalue 'Mvis'). The final outputs are "OUTDIR/vis.sorted" (plain text),
"OUTDIR/vis.html", and "OUTDIR/vis.pdf". If "-d" is set, the densed view result will be produced and stored in
"OUTDIR/vis.dense" (plain text). The plain text files are suitable for view in the terminal. The ".html" file
could be opened in a web browser like firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/) and ".pdf" could be opened in a PDF
reader like Foxit Reader (https://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/pdf-reader/).

The code scheme in the output HTML/PDF file is as follows:
-:         same neucleotide as the reference
D:         Deletions in the sequence (Note that insertions are all discarded)
A/C/G/T:   the neucleotide (which is different than the reference) in the sequencing read
grey box:  unmethylated cytosine
black box: methylated cytosine
grey dot:  gap in paired-end sequencing data
